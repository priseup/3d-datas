      FENICS <br> Software for the Automatic and Efficient Solution
      of Differential Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FENICS</b>
      is a collection of free software for the automatic and efficient
      solution of differential equations with the finite element method.
    </p>

    <p>
      FENICS provides a simple, abstract language in which the user can
      describe the computational region, the mesh, the finite element test
      and trial spaces, the boundary and initial conditions, and the solution 
      procedure.  The user may also easily request plots of the solution and
      mesh, or have the solution data written to a file for later visualization
      or analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem description takes place using the Python language.  
      This procedure is fairly simple and stereotypical, so that a user
      who can learn from examples need not first try to master Python.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once FENICS has determined the user's desires, the actual calculation is
      done using an extensive C++ library, which, depending on the installation,
      can include parallel execution under MPI, with access to powerful software
      libraries such as CHOLMOD, MTL4, PETSC, TRILINOS/Epetra, and UMFPACK.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Although FENICS can display plots interactively, it is also able to write
      solution data to a file in a Visual Toolkit (VTK) format that can be
      read in by such standard visualization packages as ParaView and VisIt.

      <b>STOKES</b> solves the steady Stokes equations for fluid flow in
      a 3D region (the unit cube).  The unknowns are the velocity vector U
      and scalar pressure field P.  The example shows how to declare the
      appropriate function space, boundary conditions, and the variational
      problem.  Because of the nature of the Stokes equations and the size
      of the linear system, a particular linear iterative solver is required,
      and preconditioning is also needed.
