          description of a triangulation
          of a set of 2D points, using a pair of files to list the node

          a data directory of examples of TRIANGULATION_ORDER6 files,
          a description of a quadratic triangulation
          of a set of 2D points, using a pair of files to list the node
          coordinates and the 6 nodes that make up each triangle;  Six-node
          triangles are used when a higher degree approximation is desired;
          they may also be used as isoparametric elements that model curved
          boundaries;
