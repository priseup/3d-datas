      <b>TETHEX</b>: 
      examples which
      illustrate the use of TETHEX,
      a C++ program which
      can read a Gmsh file defining a mesh of triangles or tetrahedrons,
      and subdivide the mesh into quadrilaterals or hexahedrons, which
      are suitable for use by the DEALII finite element program,

      <b>RECTANGLE</b> is a simple mesh of a 2D rectangle.  It was created
      by the MESH2D program, and written out as two files, one of node 
      coordinates and one of triples of node indices that define a triangle.
      These two files were read by triangulation_to_gmsh, which converted
      them to a single msh file.  Then tethex was used to convert the
      msh file of triangles into an msh file of quadrilaterals.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "rectangle_nodes.txt">rectangle_nodes.txt</a>, 
          the node coordinate file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "rectangle_elements.txt">rectangle_elements.txt</a>, 
          the element file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "rectangle.png">rectangle.png</a>, 
          an image of the original mesh, with nodes and elements labeled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "rectangle.msh">rectangle.msh</a>, 
          the msh file, using triangles, created by Gmsh.
