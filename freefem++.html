      FREEFEM++ <br> Nonlinear Multiphysics Partial Differential Equation Solver
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FREEFEM++</b>
      is a directory of examples which
      illustrate the use of the FREEFEM++ package, 
      a high-level integrated development environment for the numerical 
      solution of nonlinear multiphysics partial differential equations in
      2D and 3D.

      While trying to 'express myself' in FreeFem++, I discovered a
      few issues:
      <ul>
        <li>
          It seems that you can't use underscores in variable names.
          A statement like "real u_old = 0;" will cause an error.          
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement like "int n = 10;" is a combination of declaration
          and initialization.  If you want n to have the value 10 in one
          place and the value 20 in another, then the second operation
          is simply "n = 20;" whereas "int n = 20;" would cause an error
          since it is also attempting to declare a variable that has
          already been declared.          
        </li>
        <li>
          The finite element system should be thought of as having the form 
          <pre>
            bilinear(u,v)=linear(v)
          </pre>
          Terms belonging to the linear form must be put in a separate integral.
          Thus, a simple 2D poisson equation would be expressed by
          <pre>
            problem poisson ( u, v ) = 
              int2d ( Th ) dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v)
            - int2d ( Th ) f * v;
          </pre>
          FreeFem++ CANNOT accept this problem in a single combined integral:
          <pre>
            problem poisson ( [u,v] ) = 
              Int2d ( Th ) ( dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v) -f * v );
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      MICROWAVE is a version of a standard example from the FreeFem++ manual.
      It models the complex microwave signal in a cooker using the Helmholtz
      equation, and then the temperature response localized to an item 
      in the cooker, using the usual heat equation, with a source term
      proportional to the strength of the microwave signal.
